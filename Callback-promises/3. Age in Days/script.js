// 3. Age in Days.

// Write a JavaScript function called ageInDays that accepts an object containing a person's first name, last name, and age in years as input. The function should concatenate the first and last name into a single string and store it in a variable called fullName. It should then calculate the person's age in days and store it in a variable called ageInDays.
// The ageInDays function should then return a callback function that logs a message to the console. The message should include the person's full name and age in days, and should be in the format: "The person's full name is [full name] and their age in days is [age in days]."


// Note that the ageInDays function should not log the message to the console directly, but should instead return a callback function that can be used to log the message at a later time.

const ageInDays = (obj) => {
    const fullName = (obj.personFirstName).concat(obj.personLastName);
    const ageInDays = obj.age * 365;
    return () => console.log(`The person's full name is ${fullName} and thier age in days is ${ageInDays}`);
}
const person = {
    personFirstName: "Shreya ",
    personLastName: "Mehta",
    age: 23,
}
// console.log(person.personFirstName)
// console.log(person["personLastName"])
// calling th and executing the callback funtion together
